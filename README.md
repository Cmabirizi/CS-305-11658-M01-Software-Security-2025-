## **1. Client Summary and Software Requirements**
**Client:** Artemis Financial â€“ a financial services company handling sensitive client data.  
**Issue:** Artemis Financial required an assessment of their software security practices to identify vulnerabilities and implement secure coding techniques to prevent security breaches.  
**Goal:** Ensure secure software development practices by identifying vulnerabilities, strengthening security layers, and implementing secure coding guidelines.

## **2. Identifying and Mitigating Security Vulnerabilities**
### **What I Did Well**
- **Thorough Security Review:** Conducted **static and dynamic analysis** to identify vulnerabilities.  
- **Secure Coding Implementation:** Applied **input validation, encryption, authentication measures, and access control mechanisms**.  
- **Compliance with Best Practices:** Followed **OWASP Top 10 security principles** and industry security standards.  

### **Why Secure Coding is Important**
- Prevents **data breaches** and **financial fraud**.  
- Enhances **customer trust and regulatory compliance**.  
- Strengthens **overall security posture** of the organization, reducing financial and reputational risks.

## **3. Challenges and Lessons Learned**
### **Challenges in Vulnerability Assessment**
- Identifying **hidden vulnerabilities in legacy code** required extensive manual review and automated scanning.  
- Balancing **security enhancements with software performance**.  
- Ensuring **multi-layered security** across different application components.  

### **How I Overcame Them**
- Used **automated security tools** such as **OWASP ZAP, SonarQube, and Burp Suite**.  
- Implemented **layered security measures** like encryption, firewalls, and secure authentication.  
- Conducted **regular penetration testing and security audits**.  

---

## **4. Strengthening Software Security**
### **How I Increased Layers of Security**
- **Input Validation:** Prevented SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).  
- **Encryption:** Applied AES and hashing techniques to protect sensitive data.  
- **Authentication & Authorization:** Implemented multi-factor authentication (MFA) and role-based access control (RBAC).  
- **Security Auditing:** Regularly scanned for vulnerabilities and patched security gaps.  

### **Future Security Assessments and Mitigation Techniques**
- **Use Advanced Security Tools:** SonarQube for **static analysis**, OWASP ZAP for **dynamic analysis**, and penetration testing frameworks.  
- **Implement DevSecOps:** Integrate security within the CI/CD pipeline.  
- **Monitor for Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Stay updated with **threat intelligence and security patches**.  

---

## **5. Ensuring Functional and Secure Code**
### **Steps Taken for Secure and Functional Code**
- **Conducted Unit Testing:** Verified code behavior and functionality.  
- **Performed Code Review:** Manually checked for vulnerabilities and security loopholes.  
- **Automated Security Scans:** Used **SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, and Burp Suite** to detect issues.  

### **How I Checked for New Vulnerabilities After Refactoring**
- Ran **security regression tests** after every code update.  
- Used **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** to analyze changes.  
- Applied **logging and monitoring** to track security incidents post-deployment.

## **6. Tools and Best Practices for Future Assignments**
### **Resources & Tools Used**
- **OWASP ZAP** â€“ For vulnerability scanning.  
- **SonarQube** â€“ For static code analysis.  
- **Burp Suite** â€“ For penetration testing.  
- **Hashing & Encryption (AES, SHA-256)** â€“ To protect sensitive data.  
- **Secure Authentication (OAuth 2.0, MFA, RBAC)** â€“ For strong access control.  

### **Coding Practices Followed**
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)** â€“ Restricted user permissions.  
- **Secure Coding Guidelines** â€“ Used input validation, error handling, and secure API practices.  
- **Regular Security Updates** â€“ Ensured patches and updates for libraries and frameworks.
